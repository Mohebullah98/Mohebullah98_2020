Kargo Intern asessment

Hello Kargo Engineering,

I hope my project has been fit to your standards. I wrote my program in Java because I felt the most comfortable and confident with this language.
I am really excited for this oppurtunity and hope we will work together in the future.

Thank You, Mohebullah Mir.
